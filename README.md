# OpenGL-Sphere
Generates drawable sphere.

Defines an icosahedron using 12 vertexes and 20 triangles. Recursively subdivides each face into more triangles and vertices, and then normalizes each vertex to retain a radius of 1. Use Sphere.draw() to draw the sphere. Generates a list of triangles for use in OpenGL drawing.
